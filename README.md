# NC NEWS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a front end web app designed to let the user navigate through news articles and their associated comments.

The user is able to browse by topic, add comments and delete their own comments. In this build the user is hardcoded as the user "jessjelly".

[The app is hosted at netlify](https://art-fe-nc-news.netlify.app/)

## Running the project locally

The minimum version of node required to run this project is v13.

In order to run the project locally, first fork or clone the following repository from Github: [fe-nc-news](https://github.com/ARTurnerGit/fe-nc-news.git)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARTurnerGit/fe-nc-news.git
```

Once you have done that use the following command to run the app in development mode.

```bash
cd fe-nc-news
npm start
```

[All requests from the app are dealt with by a back end api on heroku](https://art-news-server.herokuapp.com/api). The repository for this api can be seen on Github: [be-nc-news](https://github.com/ARTurnerGit/be-nc-news.git)
